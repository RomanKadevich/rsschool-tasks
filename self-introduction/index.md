Hello! My name is Roman, I'm 29 years old, and I'd like to tell you about myself and why I decided to change my career and become a frontend developer.

Throughout my professional life, I have gained valuable experience in a different field. However, as I progressed in that sphere, I felt that my true calling was in programming. This realization motivated me to make the decision and start learning frontend development.

I have always been passionate about computer technology. In my childhood, I studied ActionScript and created animations in Flash. A few years ago, I also acquired basic knowledge of Python. These experiences allowed me to develop my creative side and inspired me to dive into the world of programming.

I have a background in management and economics. I graduated from the Academy of Management and obtained a master's degree from the Belarusian State University. After completing my studies, I worked in a construction committee, managing projects. This experience provided me with valuable skills in organization and planning, which I can apply in frontend development.

I understand that the path to becoming a frontend developer is not easy and is filled with challenges. However, I'm not afraid of these challenges. Over five months of daily studying frontend technologies have given me confidence that this is what I want to do.

Like everyone else, I have my flaws, but I am willing to learn from my mistakes and grow as a developer. When I lose motivation and realize how much material I have already studied, my monthly progress report becomes a truly inspiring force for me.

Additionally, I would like to mention two factors that play an important role in my learning journey. Firstly, I create monthly reports on the material I have covered. This helps me assess my progress and maintains motivation, especially when I realize how much I have already learned.

Secondly, my girlfriend is also studying UX/UI design, and we support each other in the learning process. We have created an inspiring atmosphere where competition fosters growth and development. We mutually support each other, exchange ideas, and discuss new techniques and trends in our field. This creates a stimulus for learning and allows us to inspire each other.

I understand that nobody is perfect, and the path to mastering programming can be challenging and full of hurdles. However, I am ready to embrace these difficulties and overcome them. My persistent motivation and dedication to learning enable me to continually improve my skills and strive for high achievements in frontend development.

I can confidently say that over five months of daily studying frontend technologies confirm my passion and dedication to this field. I am willing to put in all my efforts to become a skilled frontend developer and create impressive web applications that bring value and joy to users.

Thank you for your attention to my story. I look forward to new challenges and opportunities that frontend development offers, and I am proud to contribute to this dynamic and exciting field.
